# `shrt`: Project management

This vignette demonstrate function in the `projects` range.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(shrt)
msg(action="reset")
```


&nbsp;
## initp

`initp` creates a new directory and some subdirectories. 

```{r}
wp = initp("MyProjects")
```

The returned object is a simple list with all the directories.

Note that the messages displayed by `initp` are output via function `msg`. This means they are logged and can be retrieved

```{r}
msg(action="show")
```

See documentation for `msg` for further details. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
unlink("MyProjects", recursive=TRUE)
```
