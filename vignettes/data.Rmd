## setsummary

`setsummary` computes an overview of set membership. It takes two vectors that represent sets of objects. It outputs a list with summary statistics: the set of private members in each of the two inputs, the set of common objects, and a vector with the element counts. 

```{r}
setA = c("alpha", "beta")
setB = c("beta", "gamma", "delta")
setsummary(setA, setB)
```
