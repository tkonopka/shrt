# `shrt`: Plot-related functions

This vignette demonstrates functions in the `plot` range.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(shrt)
```

## widen

Creating a plot often starts by specifying a plot range interval. The function `widen` starts from an existing interval and calculates a related-but-wider one. The default action is to update the interval on both sides by 5%.

```{r}
widen(c(0, 100))
```

It is also possible to update the intervals by different amounts on each side, for example keeping it fixed on the left and expanding by large fraction on the right,

```{r}
widen(c(0, 100), by=c(0, 0.2))
```

When data is meant to be plotted on a logarithmic scale, the widening of the axes by a percentage is meant to be perceived after a log transformation. The `widen` function conveniently can calculate the required numerics,

```{r}
widen(c(1, 100), by=c(0, 0.2), log=TRUE)
```
